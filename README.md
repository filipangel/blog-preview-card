## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Similarly to the [first Frontend Mentor challenge](https://github.com/filipangel/qr-code-component) I solved, the design is pretty simple. Completing this challenge served as proof that I've learned something from the Codecademy HTML and CSS fundamentals courses I finished. At this point I don't understand responsive design but luckily for me this challenge does not differ much between desktop and mobile designs. In the future I hope to learn responsive design and start building mobile-first.
